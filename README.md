# xTags | Rocket Development Tags Plugin

xTags was a plugin that was originally made for [RocketDevelopment](https://github.com/RocketDevMC), but as I've moved on, and because 
the plugin is now basically obsolete due to gradients existing in later minecraft versions (but not being supported in this plugin), 
I've decided to just open-source it.

This plugin was coded at the start of 2021 if I remember correctly, so is now some pretty legacy stuff, but it's free to anyone who 
wants to use it. No license, no nonsense, use it as you wish.
